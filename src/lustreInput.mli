(** Parse a Lustre file into a transition system

    An OCaml lexer in {!LustreLexer} and a Menhir parser in
    {!LustreParser} take the input and produce a {!LustreAst.t} value,
    which is a minimally processed representation of a Lustre AST. 

    The function {!LustreSimplify.declarations_to_nodes} is called with
    this representation as input and produces a list of
    {!LustreNode.t} that contains each nodes in a normalized form, see
    {!LustreNode} and {!LustreExpr} for details.

    After finding the designated main node with
    {!LustreNode.find_main}, the definitions in the main node and list
    of nodes is reduced to the nodes in the cone of influence of the
    properties of the main node, see
    {!LustreNode.reduce_to_property_coi}. Last, the equational
    definitions of each node are ordered by their dependencies with
    {!LustreNode.reduce_to_property_coi}.

    The module {!LustreTransSys} turns the list of nodes into a
    transition system {!TransSys.t} by means of the functions
    {!LustreTransSys.trans_sys_of_nodes} and
    {!LustreTransSys.props_of_nodes}.
