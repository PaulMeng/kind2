(** Debug ouput, support for Camlp4 module

    Debug output is handled with the [Camlp4DebugParser] from the
    Camlp4 standard preprocessing libraries.

    [Camlp4DebugParser] introduces a new keyword [debug] in two
    variants: 

    [(debug {section} {format} {arg1} ... {argN} end);] 

    [debug {section} {format} {arg1} ... {argN} in] 

    Every debug message is tagged with a section, each section can be
    dynamically enabled or disabled at runtime or statically removed
    at compile-time. The section must be a lowercase keyword, not a
    quoted string.

    The first variant can be used anywhere, but must be put in
    parentheses. If compiled out, it becomes a unit value. The second
    variant can be used like a [let ... in] operator, but it may need
    to be wrapped in parentheses. If compiled out, the second variant
    disappears completely, therefore it is the preferred variant.

    The first variant is expanded to 

    [if Debug.mode {section}
    then Debug.printf {section} {format} {arg1} ... {argN} 
    else ();]

    wheras the second variant is expanded to 

    [let () = 
    if Debug.mode {section}
    then Debug.printf {section} {format} {arg1} ... {argN} 
    else () 
    in].

    The format string must not flush the formatter, this is done by
    {!printf} itself and would interfere with the indentation. For the
    same reason, line breaks with the conversion [@\\n] should not be
    used.

    The [Camlp4DebugParser] reads the environment variable
    [STATIC_CAMLP4_DEBUG], which is a colon separated list of enabled
    debug sections or an asterisk indicating that all sections are
    enabled.

    In order to enable a debug section at runtime, a call to {!enable}
    is required for each section and a [Format.formatter] must be
    given. Each debug section outputs into its associated formatter.
