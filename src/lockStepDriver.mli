(** Type of a lock step kind context. *)
type t

(** Creates a lock step driver based on a transition system. *)
val create: TransSys.t -> t

(** Deletes a lock step driver. *)
val delete: t -> unit

(** The k of the lock step driver. *)
val get_k: t -> Numeral.t

(** Increments the k of a lock step driver. Basically asserts the
   transition relation and unrolls the invariants one step further. *)
val increment: t -> unit

(** Adds new invariants to a lock step driver. *)
val new_invariants: t -> Term.t list -> unit

(** Checks if some of the input terms are falsifiable k steps from the
    initial states. Returns Some of a model at 0 if some are, None
    otherwise. *)
val query_base: t -> Term.t list -> ((Var.t * Term.t) list) option

(** Checks if some of the input terms are k-inductive. Returns a pair
    composed of the falsifiable terms and the unfalsifiable ones. *)
val query_step: t -> Term.t list -> Term.t list * Term.t list

(** Checks the lock step driver on the system below its implementation
    in the ml file. *)
val test: TransSys.t -> unit
